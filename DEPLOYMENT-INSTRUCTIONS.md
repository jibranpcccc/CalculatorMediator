# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - Ads.txt Redirect Fix

## Current Status
- ❌ Live site still serves ads.txt content directly
- ✅ All redirect configurations are correctly set up in Replit
- ✅ Build files are ready for deployment

## The Problem
The redirect configuration exists in the build files but hasn't been deployed to Netlify yet. The live site is still using the old configuration.

## The Solution
Deploy the updated build files to Netlify to activate the redirect.

## Files Ready for Deployment
```
dist/
├── index.html         (10.6KB - Complete calculator app)
├── _redirects         (104B - Redirect configuration)
├── _headers          (306B - Security headers)
├── robots.txt        (101B - SEO configuration)
└── sitemap.xml       (279B - Search engine indexing)
```

## Redirect Configuration
```
/ads.txt  https://srv.adstxtmanager.com/19390/calculatormediefacultate.com  301
/*    /index.html   200
```

## How to Deploy
1. **Commit Changes**: Push all files to your repository
2. **Netlify Deploy**: Trigger a new deployment
3. **Wait for Build**: Allow build process to complete
4. **Test Redirect**: Check if the redirect works

## Testing After Deployment
```bash
curl -I https://calculatormediefacultate.com/ads.txt
# Should return: HTTP/2 301 (redirect)
# Currently returns: HTTP/2 200 (direct content)
```

## Expected Result
After deployment:
- ✅ `/ads.txt` will redirect to ads.txt manager
- ✅ Site will work normally
- ✅ SEO and security headers will be active

## Troubleshooting
If redirect doesn't work after deployment:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Verify _redirects file is in publish directory
3. Check for any Netlify configuration conflicts
4. Ensure no other ads.txt file exists in the site

## Support
The redirect is correctly configured and will work once deployed to Netlify.
